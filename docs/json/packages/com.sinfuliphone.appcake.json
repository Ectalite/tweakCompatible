It finally broke my iPhone and after one of the resprings I lost all my system apps like settings, safari, and even Cydia. I couldn't do shit with my iPhone, thought I had to restore my phone but found a way around. I deleted AppCake folder using iFunBox on my PC and hard reset my iPhone. It worked and i got back everything. Please don't install in current state.",
